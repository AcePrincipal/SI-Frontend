# SI-Frontend

This is the Javascript frontend code for the "Ideahub" application. To begin, once the repo is cloned and navigated into, open the index.html file on your browser of choice, though I recommend Google Chrome. To do this on Windows, run `explorer.exe index.html`.

Additionally you will need to clone and follow the README.md for the backend of this application, as you will need it running appropriately, as this application is not yet hosted.

Once you have both the backend and frontend operating, navigate to the new tab that has been opened by running this apps index.html file, and notice there is a title, and images displayed beneath it. Choose an organization based off the images you see, then click on it to add your valuable idea in the comment section. You will be brought to a show page, which then will display an option to add an idea, then post it. Enjoy!
